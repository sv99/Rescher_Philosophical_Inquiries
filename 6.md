# 6. Fallacies Regarding Free Will

Philosophical controversy regarding the freedom of the will has been
astir since the dawn of the subject. The freedom at issue calls for an
agent’s being in conscious control of what they do in ways that are at
odds with the prospect that their thoughts and intentions could be
bypassed in an adequate explanation of their actions. The contradictory
position—determinism—holds instead that agent control is an illusion and
that the processes of nature settle matters of action without regard to
the substance of the agent’s mental operations.

Despite the elaborate controversies that have prevailed on this topic
over the centuries, several fallacies and flaws of thought have been
able to gain a tenacious and seemingly permanent hold on the way in
which people address the issues. It is constructive to consider some
salient examples.

## Fallacy Number One

The first fallacy inheres in an idea that Daniel Dennett has articulated
as follows:

If determinism is true, then our every deed and decision is the
inexorable outcome, it seems, of the sum of physical forces acting at
the moment; which in turn is the inexorable outcome of the forces acting
an instant before, *and so on to the
beginning of time*....\[Thus\]—If determinism is true, then our
acts are the

consequences of the laws of nature and events in the remote past. But it
is not up to us what went on before we were born, and neither is it up
to us what the laws of nature are. Therefore the consequences of these
things (including our present acts) are not up to us.<sup>1</sup>

It is exactly in this transit from “*and
so on*” to “*the beginning of
time*” that constitutes what I shall call the Zenonic fallacy. It
overlooks the prospect of backwards *convergence* as illustrated in the
following diagram:

*O*

*X* <sup>t</sup>3 <sup>t</sup>2
   <sup>t</sup>l           <sup>t</sup>0

Here *t*<sub>i+1</sub> stands
halfway between *t*<sub>i</sub>
and *X*.

Consider an occurrence *O* at
t<sub>0</sub>, putatively the product of a free decision at *X*. To explain it in terms of what
precedes, we certainly do not need to go back to “the beginning of
time.”

The failing at issue here is substantially that of Zeno’s notorious
paradox of Achilles and the tortoise. Both alike involve a fallacy in
overlooking the circumstance that, thanks to convergence, an infinity of
steps can be taken in a finite distance, provided merely that the steps
get progressively shorter. Once it is granted that, even if a cause must
precede its effect, there is no specificative timespan, however small,
by which it need do so, the causal regression argument against free will
looses all of its traction.

With Zeno, Achilles never catches the tortoise because his progress must
go on and on before the endpoint is reached. In the present reasoning,
explanation will never reach an initiating choice point because the
regress goes on and on. But in both cases, the idea of a convergence
that terminated the infinite process at issue after a finite timespan is
simply ignored.

Such a perspective leaves the principle of causality wholly compatible
with freedom because that act and all its causal antecedents remain
causally explicable.

## Fallacy Number Two

*Human choices are generally predictable
and predictability is at odds with free will.*

The reality of it is that predictability is simply no problem. If I
offer you the choice between a hundred dollar bill and a needless root
canal operation, there is no difficulty in predicting which you will
choose. But your choice is nevertheless perfectly free.

What matters for freedom is not predictability as such, but rather the
basis of prediction. If and when the prediction rests on the agent’s
tastes, dispositions, preferences, and so forth, then that decision is
free.

“But we do not choose our tastes, dispositions, and so on.” Perfectly
true, but also quite beside the point. The objection rests on an
erroneous premise: “Choices are free only if their motives are freely
chosen.” But this requirement is inappropriate and immaterial. For by
their very nature, motives, tastes, and so forth are not themselves
objects of choice at all.

Nor are they somehow forced on the agent by constituents from without.
They are not externally *imposed*,
they are internally constituted in the agent—a part of what makes an
agent into the individual he or she is. They are components of their
very nature.

## Fallacy Number Three

*If all events are explicable in the
order of natural causality, then so are all of those supposedly free
decision of agents. This means that the law of causality leaves no room
for agent causality and thus no room for free will.*

To avoid this fallacy we must draw a couple of basic distinctions. The
first and most crucial distinction here is that between two sorts of
occurrences: events and eventuations. Events are occurrences that form
part of nature’s processuality. They are happenings on the world’s
spatiotemporal stage. So they transpire over time: they have a finite
lifespan and their time of existence always occupies an open interval.

<span
style="text-decoration:line-through;">-----------\[АЛу/Ц/М</span>-----►
Time the lifespan of an event

Eventuations, by contrast, are not parts of nature’s processuality but
terminating points within it. They are temporally punctiform and lack
duration. They mark the beginnings and endings of events.

Now all human *acts* (all actions
and activities) are event-like. They occupy time. But the junctures of
resolution that mark the completion of a process of choice and decision
are not events. Such completions are not actually processual doings, but
rather are mere junctures of passage—transitions that mark the
beginnings and endings of events. Looking for something is an activity,
but actually finding it is not. (There is no present continuous here.
One can be engaged in looking but not in finding.) Listening to someone
is an activity, but hearing what they say is not. Activities are events,
terminations and completions are not. The running of a race is an event
(as are its various parts, such as running the first half of the race).
However, *fi nishing* the race is
an eventuation. Such eventuations are endings or culminations. One can
ask, “How long did he take him to *run* the race?” but not “How long did
he take to *start* the race?” And
even as the race ends when it is won (or lost), so the task ends exactly
at the moment when it is completed (or abandoned). Finishing is thus an
eventuation, and accordingly, the finishing point of a race, instead of
being the last instant of the race, is the first instant at which the
race is no longer in progress. And this is also the case with the
decisions and choices that terminate a course of deliberations.

Eventuations, so understood, are not parts of nature’s proces-sual flow,
since *parts* of processes are
always processes themselves*.
*Rather, eventuations—the beginnings and endings—belong to the
machinery of conceptualization that minds impose on nature:
instrumentalities of descriptive convenience that do not correspond to
anything enjoying independent existence in the real world. Like the
North Pole or the equator they are not real items existing physically in
nature, but rather thought instrumentalities projected into reality by
minds proceeding in the interests of description and examination.

Deliberations, so regarded, are seen as events—as processes that occur
over open-ended intervals of time and culminate in decisions as
eventuations. But these culminations are end points. And this means that
there will always be an interval of time between a decision and any
*subsequent* action—an interval
able to accommodate intervening events to serve as causal explainers of
that decision/con-sequent action. *Since
there is no such thing as a next time subsequent to a point of decision,
there will always be room for squeezing in further events before any
particular decision/subsequent event*.

The prospect of determination by events is thus ever present. And
analogously, there is not a first decision-succeeding event that
excludes the prospect of a prior occurrence-explaining event. This is
critical for the present positions regarding the causal explainability
of actions.

Freedom of decision accordingly does not impede causal explica-bility.
However, what one has in the wake of a free decision is a phenomenon
that might be characterized as *causal
compression*. Every event that ensues from that decision can be
accounted for causally— but only with reference to occurrences during
the immediately preceding but decision-subsequent timespan, whose
duration converges to zero as the point of decision is approached.

In sum: once we duly distinguish events from eventuations we can regard
all action (as events) to be causally explicable in terms of what
precedes. Free will becomes reconciled to the causal explica-bility of
actions. A free decision inaugurates a series of events each of which is
fully explicable and determinate on the order of natu-

ral causality. But this is something that is true of all those
decision-subsequent events and does not hold for that free decision
itself.

Thus while overt actions (and thereby also those that are free) will
always in principle admit of a *causal* explanation, this will not be
so with decisions and choices. And thereby hangs a lesson. Modern
science is a good deal better at explaining natural phenomena than at
explaining psychological phenomena. It is thus not surprising that
scientistically inclined determinists prefer addressing free agency
rather than free decision. But of course freedom of the will pivots
fundamentally on the latter issue, a free action being one that
emerges—however deterministically—from a free choice or decision.

## Fallacy Number Four

*Since predetermination is incompatible
with free will, so is the determination of a decision’s outcome by the
agent’s own decisionengendering deliberations.*

This objection overlooks an important distinction, namely that between
*pre-determination* and what might
be called *precedence
determination*. The former calls for predictability as of some
antecedent time; the latter involves no such thing. This crucial
difference is illustrated by the following diagram.

point of decision

time—► *t
                1*<sub>0</sub>

With *predetermination* what
happens at *t*<sub>0</sub> is
determined by (that is, law-deducible from) that which happens at some
earlier time, *t*. Already at this
earlier time the decision becomes settled: a foregone conclusion that is
reached in advance of the fact. Some earlier state of affairs renders
what occurs at the time causally inevitable. With precedence
determination, by contrast, what happens at *t*<sub>0</sub> is also determined by
what goes before—but only by *everything* that happens from some
earlier time *t* up to but not
including *1*<sub>0</sub>.<sup>2</sup> Both alike
are modes of determination by earlier history. But unlike the former,
the latter *requires an infi nite amount
of input information* that is of course never available. What we
thus have in this latter case is a mode of antecedence determination
that does not give rise to predictability but is in fact incompatible
with it.

Such precedence determination can and should be contemplated in relation
to free decisions and choices: a determination by the concluding phase
of the course of the agent’s deliberation that eventuates in the
decision or choice at issue.

Predetermination means that the outcome becomes a foregone conclusion at
some antecedent time. The entire matter becomes settled in advance of
the fact. This is indeed incompatible with free will because it deprives
the agent of the power to change his mind. There is some time in advance
of the point of decision when the whole matter becomes settled.

The events that constitute a course of deliberation antecedent to a
decision or choice so function as to determine the outcome, *it is only the endgame, the fi nal,
concluding phase that is decisive*.

Precedence determination, by contrast, means that the final phase of the
deliberation is decisive. Only the entire course of the agent’s thinking
from *some* earlier point up to
*but not including* the point of
decision suffices to settle the issue. The outcome is never settled in
advance—it isn’t over “until the fat lady sings.” And it should be clear
that this sort of antecedent determination geared to the unfolding
course of deliberation in its final phase is nowise at odds with freedom
of the will.

The situation of a free choice among alternatives is thus associated
with the following sort of picture regarding the situation at issue.

Consider, by way of example, a course of deliberation for deciding among
three alternatives, *A, B,* and
*C,* with the decision ultimately
arrived at in favor of *C* at time
t<sub>0</sub>, the “point of decision.” At every time *t* before *1*<sub>0</sub> there are three possible
outcomes, *A*, *B*, and *C,* whose probabilities at any given
time prior to *t*<sub>0</sub>
share a band of width 1 overall, as per display 6.2.

Throughout the course of deliberation these probabilities may wobble
across the probability band, but in the end, they must converge in a way
that at *t*<sub>0</sub> gives the
whole probability to one outcome alone. But at any time prior to *t*<sub>0</sub> there is a nonzero
probability that

<div>

Deliberating and Probability Dynamics

![](main-4.jpg)

</div>

any of the three outcomes will result—at no anterior time is the outcome
a foregone conclusion. The endgame is never definitively settled before
the end is reached: only at the very end (at *t*<sub>0</sub>) is there a “probability
collapse” into 1 and 0’s. Until the issue is “fully decided,” there is a
nonzero probability of the agent’s making a choice different from the
one that ultimately eventuated. As the “point of decision” is reached it
becomes more and more likely how the issue will resolve itself. But
there are no guarantees. At no time before that point of decision is
there a “point of no return” where the resolution becomes a foregone
conclusion.

So once again a distinction comes upon the scene to save the day. The
objection in view is fallacious because it overlooks the crucial
distinction between the two very different modes of “determination by
what precedes” represented respectively by pre-determination and
precedence determination of the sort just described.

And one other point is important here. The first question to ask of any
mode of determinism is determination *by
what*? By matters outside the agent’s range of motivation is one
thing. But by the agent’s own deliberations—by the manifold of
inclination that encompasses his wants, wishes, aims, and choices is
something else again. After all, determination of decision outcomes by
the agent’s thoughts is surely a requisite of free will rather than an
obstacle to it.

## Fallacy Number Five

*An act can be free only if its
productive source is located in the thoughts and deliberations of the
agent. But this is never the case because the tight linkage of mind
activity to brain activity means that the thoughts and deliberations of
the agent’s mind are always rooted in and explicable through the
processes at work in the agent’s brain.*

To see what is amiss here consider the fact that two parameters are
lockstep coordinated does not settle—or even address—the issue of which
one has processual initiative.

All of those myriad illustrations of a correlation between thought and
brain activity are simply immaterial to the issue of who is in charge.
Either direction remains possible. For the determinist, to be sure,
agents are productively inert—what they do is always the product of what
happens to them: they simply provide the stage on which the causality of
nature performs its drama. The voluntarist, by contrast, sees
intelligent agents as productively active participants in the drama of
the world’s physical processuality. And the reality of it is that
mind-brain correlation cannot effectively be used against him. It is
simply fallacious to think that the intimate linkage between brain
activity and thought puts the brain in charge of the mind.

With such an approach, the brain/mind is seen as an emergently evolved
dual-aspect organization whose two interlinked domains permit the
impetus for change to lie sometimes on the one side and sometimes on the
other side. For the *direction* of
determination so far remains open. Given these interlocked variables,
the question of the dependent versus the independent status is wholly
open, and the question of *initiative* is unresolved. And the fact
that the mind and brain sail in the same boat is no reason why the mind
cannot occasionally seize the tiller. What is at issue is a partnership
of *coordination,* not a state of
inflexible master-servant *subordination.* In particular
situations, the initiative can lie on one side or the other— all
depending.

But all depending on what? How does it get decided where the initiative
lies? Well—think of the pulley situation. When the cube rises, is this
because someone is pushing up on it or because a bird has alighted on
the sphere? The system itself taken in isolation will not answer this
for you, but the wider context—the overall causality synoptic and
dynamic context—will decide where the initiative lies. It is all a
matter of where the activity starts and what stands at the end of the
causal line. And the free will situation is much the same. When I read,
the mind responds to the body; when I write, the body responds to the
mind.

## Fallacy Number Six

*If the acts of an agent are anywise
determined—if they are somehow, that is, anywise necessitated—then they
cannot possibly qualify as free.*

Both Aristotle and the Stoics sought to reconcile the volitional freedom
they deemed requisite for morality with the determinism they saw
operative in the circumstance that character dictates decisions. To
accomplish this without adopting the Platonic myth of character
selection, they maintained that what would impede freedom is not
determination as such but only *exogenous* determination rooted in
factors outside the agent’s self-produced motivations. The crux of
freedom, so viewed, is not indetermination but autodetermination—
determination effected by the agent’s agency itself— *sua sponite* as the medievals put it.

With such a compatibilist view, the crux of the matter is not whether or
not there is determinism—it is conceded that there indeed is, albeit of
the agent-internal variety. The crux is whether there is an
agent-external determinism—a determinism where all reference to the
agent and their motivations can be out of consideration in matters of
explanation. The issue of freedom does not turn on the *that* of determination, but on its
*how*, its procedural mechanisms.
For as long as those deliberative factors are critical for
determination, the basis for freedom is secured.

Thus, we have a distinction here between endogenous (agent-internal) and
exogenous (agent-external) determination. Clearly if that determination
is effected without reference to the agent by forces and factors above
and beyond his control by thought, then we can hardly characterize that
agent as free. But if those determinative factors are

agent-internal, if they are a matter of the agent’s own plans and
projects, his own wishes, desires, and purposes, then the deliberation
of the values of decisions and choices nowise stands in the way of the
agent’s freedom. A choice or decision that was not the natural and
inevitable outcome of the agent’s motivations could hardly qualify as a
free decision.

And so freedom of the will is nowise at odds with the principle of
causality as long as the locus of causal determination is located in the
thought process of the agent—that is, as long as causal determination is
canalized through the mediation of the choices and decisions emergent
from his deliberations. And there is consequently no opposition between
freedom and causal determination as long as that determination is
effected by what transpires in the principle of agents and the matter is
one of agent causality.<sup>3</sup>

In sum, to set free will at odds with determinacy is fundamentally
fallacious because it rides roughshod over the crucial distinction— that
between the agent-external causality of impersonal events and the
agent-internal causality that involves deliberative thought.

## Fallacy Number Seven

*Free will is mysterious and
supranatural. For it requires a suspension of disbelief regarding the
standard view of natural occurrence subject to the principle of
causality.*

Along these lines one recent writer complains:<sup>4</sup>

Agent causation is a frankly mysterious doctrine, positing something
unparalleled by anything we discover in the causal processes of chemical
reactionism, nuclear fission and fusion, magnetic attraction,
hurricanes, volcanoes, or such biological processes as metabolism,
growth, immune reactions, and photosynthesis. Is there such a thing?
When libertarians insist that there must be, they \[build upon
sand\].<sup>5</sup>

But this sort of complaint is deeply problematic.

Free will, properly regarded, hinges on the capacity of the mind to
seize the initiative in effecting changes in the developmental course of
mind-brain coordinated occurrence. Need this, or *should* this, be seen as something
mysterious and supranatural?

With the evolution of minds upon the world stage, various capacities and
capabilities come upon the scene emergently, adding new sorts of
operations to the repertoire of mammalian operations— remembering past
occurrences, for example, or imagining future ones. And one of these
developmental innovations is the capacity of the mind to take the
initiative in effecting change in the setting of the mind from
coordinate developments.

Now the explanatory rationale for this innovation is substantially the
same as that for any other sort of evolution-emergent capability, namely
that it contributes profitability to the business of natural selection.
There is nothing mysterious or supranatural about it.

And so this present fallacy rests on a failure of imagination. It is
predicated in an inability to actualize that with the evolution of
intelligent agents there arises the prospect of intelligence-guided
agency determined through the deliberations of these intelligent agents.

## Fallacy Number Eight

Down the corridors of time have echoed the words of Spinoza:

Men believe that they are free, precisely because they are conscious of
their volitions and decisions, and think not in the slightest about the
causes that dispose them to those appetites and volitions, since they
are unknown to them.<sup>6</sup>

Apparently Spinoza thought (perhaps with Freud) that action is only
genuinely free when it is activated entirely by recognized and
rationally evaluated and approved motives. But this simply confounds
*free* with *rational* agency. As long as the agent
acts on his own mo-tives—without external duress or manipulation—his
action is free in the standard (rather than rationalistically
reconfigured) sense of the term. Motivation as such does not impede
freedom—be it rationally grounded or not. Our motives, however
inappropriate and ill-advised they may be and however little understood
in terms of their psychogenesis, do not *constrain* our will externally but are
the very core of its expression.

A will that is responsive to an agent’s motivation is thereby free and
it matters not how compelling that motive may be in relation to the
resolution at issue.<sup>7</sup> After all, a person’s nature is
manifested in his or her decisions and finds its overt expression
realized in that person. His or her decisions are nothing but the overt
manifestation of an inner motivational nature. It is through decisions
and consequent actions that people display what they actually are.

Consider this situation. I ask someone to pick a number from one to six.
They select six. I suspected as much: their past behavior indicates a
preference for larger numbers over smaller and for evens over odds. So
their choice was not entirely random. Does that make it unfree? Not at
all! It was nowise forced or constrained. Those number preferences were
not external pressures that restricted freedom: on the contrary they
paved the way to self-expression. It would be folly to see freedom as
antithetical to motivation. Quite to the contrary! Volitional freedom is
a freedom to indulge one’s motivations.

To “free” the will from obeisance to the agent’s aims and motives, needs
and wants, desires and goals, likes and values, personality and
disposition is not to liberate it, but to make it into something that is
not just useless but even counterproductive. What rational agent would
want to be harnessed to the decision-effecting instrumentality that left
his motivations by the wayside? A will detached from the agent’s motives
would surely not qualify as *his*!
It is a rogue will, not a personal one.

## Fallacy Number Nine

*The very idea of free will is
antithetical to science. Free will is something occult that cannot
possibly be naturalized.*

It is—or should be—hard to work up much sympathy to this objection. For
if free will exists—if *Homo
sapiens* can indeed make free choices and decisions—then this of
course has to be part of the natural order of things. So if we indeed
are free then this has to be so for roughly the same reason that we are
intelligent—that is, because evolution works things out that way.

What lies at the heart and core of free will is, up to the last moment,
thought control by a rational agent of their deliberation-produced
choices and decisions in the light of their ongoing updated information
and evaluation. To see that such a capacity is of advantage in matters
of survival is not a matter of rocket science.

The objection at issue is thus fallacious in that it rests in the
inappropriate presupposition that free will has to be something super-
or preternatural. If there is free will, it will have to be an aspect of
how naturally evolved beings operate on nature’s stage. The fact that we
humans get here by evolution does not mean that we cannot make free
decisions anymore than it does not mean that we cannot solve calculus
problems or play chess. There simply is no decisive reason for denying
that just as evolution is capable of having intelligent beings evolve,
so it is capable of having intelligent agents evolve—crea-tures whose
actions are the product of thought-determined decisions.

But enough! We have now looked at nine fallacious arguments against
freedom of the will, and the list could easily be continued. But the
overall lesson should already be clear. Time and again a misconception
arises that can be overcome by drawing appropriate distinctions whose
heed makes for a more viable construal of how freedom of the will—if
such there is—should be taken to work. So at each stage there is some
further clarification of what free will involves. There gradually
emerges from the fog an increasingly clear view that what is at issue
here is the capacity of intelligent beings to resolve matters of choice
and decision through a process of deliberation on the basis of beliefs
and desires that allows for ongoing updates and up to the bitter end
revisability.

And so while these present considerations do not establish that the will
is free, nevertheless they provide for a dialectic of the following
structure:

The general tenor of everyday experience leads people to think of
themselves as free agents who control their decisions and actions. In
the face of the pro-presumption that this circumstance establishes, it
will take a strong argument to the contrary to defeat it. But the flaws
and fallacies one encounters throughout the range of the standard
determinist arguments serve to indicate that the opposition simply lacks
the requisite strength to prevail.

Properly understood, freedom of the will should not be at odds with our
knowledge about how things work in the world. A viable theory of free
will should—nay, must—proceed on a naturalistic basis. And the idea that
this is infeasible appears to be, by all the available indications,
based on an incorrect and fallacious view of what freedom of the will is
all about.
