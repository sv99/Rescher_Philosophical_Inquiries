# 12. The Power of Ideals*

## The Service of Ideals

Ideals pivot on the question, “If I could shape the world as I want, how
would I have it be?” And, of course, *every* voluntary action of ours is in
some manner a remaking of the world—at any rate, of a very small corner
of it—by projecting into reality a situation that otherwise would not
be. To act intelligently is to act with due reference to the *direction* in which our own actions
shift the course of things. And this is exactly where ideals come into
play. Our ideals guide and consolidate our commitment to human virtues
in general and moral excellences in particular. Courage and
unselfishness provide examples, seeing that they often lead beyond “the
call of duty,” exhibiting a dimension of morality that transcends the
boundaries of obligation in a way that is typical of ideals.

In an influential 1958 paper, the English philosopher J. O. Urmson
stressed the ethical importance of Christian theology’s conception of
works of supererogation (*opera
supererogationis*),<sup>1</sup> reemphasizing the traditional
contrast between the *basic*
morality of duties and the *higher* morality of preeminently
creditable action “above and beyond the call of duty.” Such
supererogation is best conceived of not in terms of duty but in terms of
dedication to an ideal. The values at issue are often symbolized in such
“role models” as heroes and saints. An ethic of ideals can accommodate
what is at issue here in ways that a mere ethic of duty cannot. Nobody
has a *duty* to his fellows to
become a saint or hero; this just is not something we *owe* to people, be it singly or
collectively. Here, we are dealing with something that is not so much a
matter of actual duty as one of dedication to an ideal—the benevolent,
inner impetus to make the world a better place.

There is always something unrealistic about ideals. So what are they
good for? Many things. A knowledge of their ideals gives us much insight
into what people do: “By their ideals shall ye know them.” We get to
know a great deal about someone when we know about his or her
ideals—about their dreams, their heroes, and their utopias. The question
of what gods somebody worships—power or fame or Mammon or Jehovah—does
much to inform us about the sort of person we are dealing with. (To be
sure, what we do not yet know is how *dedicated* this person to those
ideals—how energetically and assiduously he or she puts them to work.)

Human aspiration is not restricted by realities—neither by the realities
of the present moment (from which our sense of future possibilities can
free us), nor even by our view of realistic future prospects (from which
our sense of the ideal possibilities can free us). Our judgment is not
bounded by what *is*, nor by what
*will* be, nor even by what *can* be. There is always also our view
of what *should* be. The vision of
our mind’s eye extends to circumstances beyond the limits of the
possible. A proper appreciation of ideals calls for a recognition of
man’s unique dual citizenship in the worlds of the real and the ideal—a
realm of facts and a realm of values.

It is remarkable that nature has managed to evolve a creature who
aspires to more than nature can offer, who never totally feels at home
in its province, but lives, to some extent, as an alien in a foreign
land. All those who feel dissatisfied with the existing scheme of
things, who both yearn *and
strive* for something better and finer than this world affords,
have a touch of moral grandeur in their makeup that deservedly evokes
admiration.

Sceptically inclined “realists” have always questioned the significance
of ideals on the grounds that, being unrealizable, they are presumably
pointless. But this fails to reckon properly with the realities of the
situation. For while ideals are, in a way, mere fictions, they
nevertheless direct and canalize our thought and action. To be sure, an
ideal is not a goal we can expect to attain. But it serves to set a
direction in which we can strive. Ideals are irrealities, but they are
irrealities that condition the nature of the real through their
influence on human thought and action. Stalin’s cynical question, “But
how many divisions has the Pope?” betokens the Soviet *Realpolitiker* rather than the Marxist
ideologue (how many soldiers did Karl Marx command?). It is folly to
underestimate the strength of an attachment to ideals. Though in itself
impracticable, an ideal can nevertheless importantly influence our
praxis and serve to shape the sort of home we endeavor to make for
ourselves in a difficult world.

Ideals take us beyond experience into the realm of *imagination*— outside of what we do
find, or expect to find, here in this real world, it is the region of
wishful thinking, of utopian aspiration, of what we would fain have if
only (alas!) we could. Admittedly, this envisions a perfection or
completion that outreaches not only what we actually have attained, but
even what we can possibly attain in this sublunary dispensation.
However, to give this up, to abandon casting those periodic wistful
glances in the “transcendental” direction is to cease to be fully,
genuinely, and authentically human. In following empiricists and
positivists by fencing the ideal level of deliberation off behind “No
Entry” signs, we diminish the horizons of human thought to its grave
impoverishment. (As is readily illustrated by examples from Galileo and
Einstein, there is a valid place for thought experiments that involve
idealization even in the domain of the natural sciences themselves.)

The level of idealized contemplation provides a most valuable conceptual
instrument, for it affords us a most useful *contrast conception *that serves to
shape and condition our thought. Like the functionary imperial Rome that
stood at the emperor’s side to whisper intimations of mortality into his
ear, so idealizations serve to remind us of the fragmentary, incomplete,
and parochial nature of what we actually manage to accomplish. If the
ideal level of consideration were not there for purposes of contrast, we
would constantly be in danger of ascribing to the parochially proximate
a degree of completeness or adequacy to which it has no just claims.

To prohibit our thought from operating at the idealized level that
transcends the reach of actual experience would create a profound
impoverishment of our intellectual resources. To block off our entry
into the sphere of perfection represented by the ideal level of
consideration is to cut us off from a domain of thought that
characterizes us as intellectually amphibious creatures able to operate
in the realm of realities and ideals.

Granted, our expulsion from the Garden of Eden has cut us off from the
domain of completeness, perfection, comprehensiveness, and totality. We
are constrained to make do with the flawed realities of a mundane and
imperfect world. But we aspire to more. Beset by a “divine discontent,”
we cannot but yearn for that unfettered completeness and perfection,
which (as empiricists rightly emphasize) the limited resources of our
cognitive situation cannot actually afford us. Not content with
graspable satisfactions, we seek far more and press outward “beyond the
limits of the possible.” It is a characteristic *and worthy* feature of humans to let
their thought reach out toward a greater completeness and
comprehensiveness than anything actually available within the mundane
sphere of secured experience. *Homo
sapiens* alone among earthly creatures is a being able and
(occasionally) willing to work toward the realization of a condition of
things that does not and perhaps even cannot exist—a state of affairs
where values are fully and comprehensively embodied. They are agents who
can change and transform the world, striving to produce something that
does not exist save in the mind’s eye, and indeed cannot actually exist
at all because its realization calls for a greater perfection and
completeness than the recalcitrant conditions of this world allow. Our
commitment to this level of deliberation makes us into a creature that
is something more than a rational animal—a creature that moves in the
sphere of not only ideas but ideals as well.

## The Pragmatic Validation of Ideals

What do ideals do for us? What useful role can they play in the human
scheme of things? The answer runs something like this: *Homo sapiens* is a rational agent.
People can act and must choose among alternative courses of action. This
crucial element of choice means that our actions will be guided in the
first instance by considerations of “necessity,” relating to survival
and physical well-being. But to some extent they can, and in an advanced
condition of human development *must*, go far beyond this point.
Eventually, they come to be guided by necessity-transcending
considerations, by man’s “higher” aspira-tions—his yearning for a life
that is not only secure and pleasant but also *meaning ful*, having some element of
excellence or nobility about it. Ideals are the guideposts toward these
higher, excellence-oriented aspirations. As such, they motivate rather
than constrain, urge rather than demand.

The validation of an ideal is ultimately derivative. It does not lie in
the (unrealizable) state of affairs that it contemplates—in that
inherently unachievable perfection it envisions. Rather, it lies in the
influence that it exerts on the lives of its human exponents through the
mediation of thought. To be sure, one ideal can be evaluated in terms of
another. But to appraise ideals in a way that avoids begging the
question through other idealizations, we do well to leave the domain of
idealization altogether and enter into that of the realistically
practical. The superiority of one ideal over another must be tested by
its *practical consequences* for
human well-being. “By their fruits shall ye know them.” In appraising
ideals we must look not to the *nature
*of these ideals alone but also to their *work*. The key role of an ideal is to
serve as an instrument of decision making—a sort of navigation
instrument for use in the pursuit of the good. And here, the homely
practical goods that stand correlative to our needs—survival, health,
well-being, human solidarity, happiness, and the like—come into their
own once more. Those higher values validate their legitimacy in terms of
their bearing on the quotidian ones. The crucial role of ideals lies in
their capacity to help us to make the world a better place. There is no
conflict between the demands of (valid) practice and the cultivation of
(appropriate) ideals. The bearing of the practical and the ideal stand
in mutually supportive cooperation.

Such a perspective of course begs the question against the empiricist
and sceptic. He wants to play it safe—to have assurances that operations
on that empyrean level cannot get us into intellectual or practical
mischief. And we must concede to him that such advance assurances cannot
be given. We live in a world without guarantees. All we can say is: “Try
it, you’ll like it—you’ll find with the wisdom of hindsight that you
have achieved useful results that justify the risks.”

The impracticability of its realization is thus no insuperable obstacle
to the validation of an ideal. This issue of its feasibility or
infeasibility is simply beside the point, because what counts with an
ideal is not the question of its attainment but the overall benefits
that accrue from its pursuit. Having and pursuing an ideal, regardless
of its impracticability, can yield benefits such as a better life for us
and a better world for our posterity. The validation of an ideal thus
lies in the pragmatic value of its pursuit. As Max Weber observed with
characteristic perspicuity, even in the domain of politics, which has
been called the art of the possible, “the possible has frequently been
attained only through striving for something impossible that lies beyond
one’s reach.”<sup>2</sup>

There are, of course, competing and potentially conflicting ideals.
Aldous Huxley wrote:

About the ideal goal of human effort there exists in our civilization
and, for nearly thirty centuries, there has existed a very general
agreement. From Isaiah to Karl Marx the prophets have spoken with one
voice. In the Golden Age to which they look forward there will be
liberty, peace, justice, and brotherly love. “Nation shall no more lift
sword against nation”; “the free development of each will lead to the
free development of all”; “the world shall be full of the knowledge of
the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.”<sup>3</sup>

But Susan Stebbing took Huxley sharply to task here:

In this judgment Mr. Huxley appears to me to be mistaken.

There is not now, and there was not in 1937 when Mr. Huxley made this
statement, “general agreement” with regard to “the ideal goal of human
effort,” even in Western Europe, not to mention Eastern Asia. The
Fascist ideal has been conceived in sharpest opposition to the values
which Mr. Huxley believes to be so generally acceptable, and which may
be said to be characteristic of the democratic idea. The opposition is
an opposition with regard to modes of social organization; it . . .
necessitates fundamental differences in the methods employed to achieve
aims that are totally opposed. The ideal of Fascism is power and the
glorification of the State; the idea of democracy is the development of
free and happy human beings; consequently, their most fundamental
difference lies in their different conceptions of the worth of human
beings as individuals worthy of respect.<sup>4</sup>

And Stebbing is quite right. Potentially conflicting ideals are a fact
of life. Different priorities can be assigned to different values, and
to prize *A* over *B,* is incompatible with prizing *B* over *A*. But of course, the prospect of goal
alternatives no more invalidates one’s ideals than the prospect of
spouse alternatives invalidates one’s marriage. The justification and
power of an ideal inhere in its capacity to energize and motivate human
effort toward productive results—in short, in its practical efficacy.
Ideals may involve unrealism, but this nowise annihilates their impetus
or value precisely because of the practical consequences that ensue upon
our adoption of them.

But what are we to make of the fact that competing and conflicting
ideals are possible—that not only can different people have different
ideals, but one person can hold several ideals that unkind fate can
force into situations of conflict and competition (“the devoted spouse”
and “the successful politician,” for example)?

Clearly, we have to make a good deal of this. Many things follow,
including at least the following points: that life is complex and
difficult; that perfection is not realizable; that lost causes may claim
our allegiance and conflicts of commitment arise; that realism calls on
us to harmonize our ideals, even as it requires us to harmonize our
other obligations in an overall economy of values. It follows, in sum,
that we must make various reciprocal adjustments and compromises. But
one thing that does not follow is that ideals are somehow illegitimate
and inappropriate.

To attain the limits of the possibilities inherent in our powers and
potentialities, we must aim beyond them. And just here lies the great
importance of the ideal realm. Human action cannot, in general, be
properly understood or adequately managed without a just appreciation of
the guiding ideals that lie in the background. For human intervention in
the real world sometimes is—and often should be— conditioned by views of
the ideal order, in whose direction they find it appropriate to steer
the course of events.

This situation has its paradoxical aspect. Ideals may seem to be
otherworldly or remote from our practical concerns. But in a wider
perspective, they are eminently practical, so that their legitimacy is
ultimately pragmatic. The imperative to ideals has that most practical
of all justifications in that it enhances the prospects of a more
satisfying life. Paradoxical though it may seem, this pragmatic line is
the most natural and sensible approach to the validation of ideals.

The general principle of having ideals can be defended along the
following lines:

Q: Why should people have ideals at all?

*A:* Because it is something that
is efficient and effective in implementing their pursuit of values.

Q: But why should they care for the pursuit of values?

A: That is simply a part of being human, and thus subject to the
fundamental imperative of realizing one’s potential of flourishing as
the kind of creature one is.

The validity of having ideals inheres in the condition of man as an
amphibian, dwelling in a world of both facts and values.

Admittedly, ideals cannot be brought to actualization as such. Their
very “idealized” nature prevents the arrangements they envision from
constituting part of the actual furnishings of the world. But in the
sphere of human endeavor we cannot properly explain and understand the
reality about us without reference to motivating ideals. The
contemplation of what should ideally be is inevitably bound to play an
important role in the rational guidance of our actions.

The validation and legitimation of ideals accordingly lies not in their
(infeasible) *applicability* but
in their *utility* for directing
our ef-forts—their productive power in providing direction and structure
to our evaluative thought and pragmatic action. It is in this, their
power to move the minds that move mountains, that the validation and
legitimation of appropriate ideals must ultimately reside.

## The Grandeur of Ideals

To say that the ultimate legitimation of ideals is pragmatic in
orientation is not to say that they are *merely* practical—that they are somehow
crass, mundane, and bereft of nobility. By no means! The mode of *justification* of ideals has
effectively no bearing on their *nature* at all. Their validation may be
utilitarian, but theirinherent character remains transcendent. And so
there need be nothing crass or mundane about our ideals as such.

With societies and nations, as with individuals, a balanced vision of
the good calls for a proportionate recognition of *the domestic impetus* concerned with
the well-being of people, home and hearth, stomach and pocketbook, good
fellowship, rewarding work, and so on. But it also calls for recognition
of *the heroic impetus* concerned
with acknowledging ideals, making creative achievements, playing a
significant role on the world-historical stage, and doing those splendid
things upon which posterity looks with admiration. Above all, this
latter impetus involves winning battles, not on the battlefield but in
the human mind and spirit. The absence of ideals is bound to impoverish
a person or a society. Toward people or nations that have the
constituents of material welfare, we may well feel envy, but our *admiration* and *respect* could never be won on this
ground alone. Excellence must come into it. And in this
excellence-connected domain, we leave issues of utility behind and enter
another sphere— that of human ideals relating to man’s higher and nobler
aspirations.

*Homo sapiens* is a rational
animal. The fact that we are animals squarely places us within the order
of nature. But the fact that we are rational exempts us from an absolute
rule by external forces. It means that our nature is not wholly *given*, that we are able to contribute
in at least some degree toward making ourselves into the sort of
creatures we are. A rational creature is inevitably one that has some
capacity to let its idealized vision of what it should be determine what
it actually is. It is in this sense that an involvement with ideals is
an essential aspect of the human condition.

## The Practicality of Ideals

Their transcendental and fictional nature accordingly does not destroy
the usefulness of ideals. To be sure, we do not—should not— expect to
bring our ideals to actual realization. Yet, an ideal is like the Holy
Grail of medieval romance: it impels us onward in our journey and gives
meaning and direction to our efforts. Rewards of dignity and worth lie
in these efforts themselves, irrespective of the question of actual
attainment. When appraising a person’s life, the question, “What did he
endeavor?” is as relevant as the question, “What did he achieve?”

The objects at issue in our ideals are not parts of the world’s
furniture. Like utopias and mythic heroes (or the real-world heroes we
redesign in their image by remaking these people into something that
never was), ideals are “larger than life.” The states of affairs at
issue with ideals do not and cannot exist as such. If we look about us
where we will, we shall not find them actualized. The directive impetus
that they give us generally goes under the name of “inspiration.” They
call to us to bend our efforts toward certain unattainable goals. Yet,
though fictions, they are eminently *practical* fictions. They find their
utility not in application to the things of this world but in their
bearing upon the thoughts that govern our actions within it. They are
not *things* as such but *thought instrumentalities* that orient
and direct our praxis in the direction of realizing a greater good.

Yet ideals, though instruments of thought, are not mere myths. For there
is nothing false or fictional about ideals as such—only about the idea
of their embodiment in concrete reality. Their pursuit is something that
can be perfectly real—and eminently productive. (And it is at this
pragmatic level that the legitimation of an ideal must ultimately be
sought.)

Still, given the inherent unrealizability of what is at issue, are
ideals not indelibly irrational?

Here, as elsewhere, we must reckon with the standard gap between
aspiration and attainment. In the practical sphere—for example, in
craftsmanship or the cultivation of our health—we may *strive* for perfection, but we cannot
ever claim to *attain* it.
Moreover, the situation in inquiry is exactly parallel, as is that in
morality or in statesmanship. The cognitive ideal of perfected science
stands on the same level as the moral ideal of a perfect agent or the
political ideal of a perfect state. The value of such unrealizable
ideals lies not in the (unavailable) benefits of attainment but in the
benefits that accrue from pursuit. The view that it is rational to
pursue an aim only if we are in a position to achieve its attainment or
approximation is simply mistaken. As we have seen, an unattainable end
can be perfectly valid (and entirely rational) if the indirect benefits
of its pursuit are sufficient—if in striving after it, we realize
relevant advantages to a substantial degree. An unattainable ideal can
be enormously productive.

The issue of justifying the adoption of unattainable ideals thus brings
us back to the starting point of these deliberations—the defense of the
appropriateness of fighting for lost causes. Optimal results are often
attainable only by trying for too much—by reaching beyond the limits of
the possible. Man is a dual citizen in the realms of reality and
possibility. He must live and labor in the one but *toward *the other. The person whose
wagon is not hitched to some star or other is not a full-formed human
being; he is less than he can and should be.

It seems particularly incongruous to condemn the pursuit of ideals as
contrary to *rationality*. For one
thing, the crux of rationality lies in the intelligent pursuit of
appropriate ends, and ideals constitute a crucial part of the framework,
being the points of reference toward which our determinations of
appropriateness proceed. No less relevant, however, is the fact that a
good case can be made for holding that complete rationality is itself
something unrealizable, given the enormously comprehensive nature of
what is demanded (for example, by recourse to the principle of total
evidence for rationally constituted belief and action). Neither in
matters of thought nor in matters of action can we ever succeed in being
totally and completely rational; we have to recognize that perfect
rationality is itself an unattainable ideal. And we must be realistic
about the extent to which we can implement this ideal amid the harsh
realities of a difficult world. Yet even though total rationality is
unattainable, its pursuit is nevertheless perfectly rational because of
the great benefits that it palpably engenders. It is thus ironic that
the thoroughgoing rationality, in whose name the adoption of
unattainable ends is sometimes condemned, itself represents an
unattainable ideal, whose pursuit is rationally defensible only by
pragmatically oriented arguments of the general sort considered here.

And so, it is important—and crucially so—for a person to have guiding
ideals. A life without ideals need not be a life without purpose, but it
will be a life without purposes of a sort in which one can appropriately
take reflective satisfaction. The person for whom values matter so
little that he or she has no ideals is condemned to wander through life
disoriented, without guiding beacons to furnish that sense of direction
that gives meaning and a point to the whole enterprise. Someone who
lacks ideals suffers an impoverishment of spirit for which no other
resources can adequately compensate.<sup>5</sup>
