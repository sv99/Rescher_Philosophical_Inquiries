Before getting down to the book’s proper work, a brief preliminary word about the nature of the enterprise is in order. This book is compiled in the spirit of Bertrand Russell’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Problems of Philosophy</span> and A. J. Ayer’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Central Questions in Philosophy</span> as an attempt by a senior philosopher to give a sort of cook’s tour conspectus of major philosophical issues. It is not a students’ introduction to philosophy, nor does it seek to provide a comprehensive survey of the field—no single volume could hope to do this, let alone such a brief one. Rather, the object is to give an instructive panorama of one philosopher’s views on some of the major issues of the field. And so, it is hoped, that the book succeeds in presenting a series of readily comprehensive studies of significant philosophical issues that manage to convey some of one particular philosopher’s ideas on key issues in an informative and accessible way.
