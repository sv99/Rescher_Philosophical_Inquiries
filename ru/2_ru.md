Before getting down to the book’s proper work, a brief preliminary word
about the nature of the enterprise is in order. This book is compiled in
the spirit of Bertrand Russell’s <span
style="font-style:italic;">Problems of Philosophy</span> and A. J.
Ayer’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Central Questions in
Philosophy</span> as an attempt by a senior philosopher to give a sort
of cook’s tour conspectus of major philosophical issues. It is not a
students’ introduction to philosophy, nor does it seek to provide a
comprehensive survey of the field—no single volume could hope to do
this, let alone such a brief one. Rather, the object is to give an
instructive panorama of one philosopher’s views on some of the major
issues of the field. And so, it is hoped, that the book succeeds in
presenting a series of readily comprehensive studies of significant
philosophical issues that manage to convey some of one particular
philosopher’s ideas on key issues in an informative and accessible way.

I am very grateful to Estelle Burris for her ever-competent assistance
in preparing this material for the press.
