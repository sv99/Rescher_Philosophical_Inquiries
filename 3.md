# 3. Limits of Science

## Conditions of Perfected Science

How far can the scientific enterprise advance toward a definitive
understanding of reality? Might science attain a point of recognizable
completion? Is the achievement of perfected science a genuine
possibility, even in theory when all of the “merely practical” obstacles
are put aside as somehow incidental?

What would *perfected science*
actually be like? What sort of standards would it have to meet? Clearly,
it would have to complete in full the discharge of natural science’s
mandate or mission. Now, the goal-structure of scientific inquiry covers
a good deal of ground. It is diversified and complex, spreading across
both the cognitive/theo-retical and active/practical sectors. It
encompasses the traditional quartet of description, explanation,
prediction, and control, in line with display 3.1.

The theoretical sector of science concerns itself with matters of
characterizing, explaining, accounting for, and rendering
intel-ligible—with purely intellectual and informative issues, in short.

By contrast, the practical sector is concerned with deciding actions,
guiding expectations, and, in general, with achieving the control over
our environment that is required for the satisfactory conduct of our
affairs. The former sector thus deals with what science enables us to
*say*, and the latter with what it
enables us to *do*. The one
relates to our role as spectators of nature, the other to our role as
active participants.

It thus appears that if we are to claim that our science has attained a
perfected condition, it would have to satisfy (at least) the four
following conditions:

-   1. *Erotetic completeness*: It
    must answer, in principle at any rate, all those descriptive and
    explanatory questions that it countenances as legitimately raisable
    and must accordingly explain everything it deems explicable.

-   2. *Predictive completeness*:
    It must provide the cognitive basis for accurately predicting those
    eventuations that are in principle predictable (that is, those that
    it recognizes as such).

-   3. *Pragmatic completeness*:
    It must provide the requisite cognitive means for doing whatever is
    feasible for beings like ourselves to do in the circumstances in
    which we labor.

-   4. *Temporal finality* (the
    omega-condition of ultimate finality): It must leave no room for
    expecting further substantial changes that destabilize the existing
    state of scientific knowledge.

Each of these modes of substantive completeness deserves detailed
consideration. First, however, one brief preliminary remark: it is clear
that any condition of science that might qualify as “perfected” would
have to meet certain formal requirements of systemic unity. If, for
example, there are different routes to one and the same question (for
instance, if both astronomy and geology can inform us about the age of
the Earth), then these answers will certainly have to be consistent.
Perfected science will have to meet certain requirements of structural
systematicity in the manner of its articulation: it must be coherent,
consistent, consonant, uniform, harmonious, and so on. Such requirements
represent purely formal cognitive demands upon the architectonic of
articulation of a body of science that could lay any claim to
perfection. Interesting and important though they are, we shall not,
however, trouble about these *formal* requirements here, our present
concern being with various *substantive* issues.<sup>1</sup>

## Issues of Theoretical Completeness

Erotetic completeness is surely an unattainable mirage. We can never
exhaust the possibility of questions. The Kantian principle of question
propagation means that inquiry—the dialectic of questions and
answers—can never get to the ultimate bottom of things.

Any adequate theory of inquiry must recognize that the ongoing progress
of science is a process of *conceptual* innovation that always
leaves certain theses wholly outside the cognitive range of the
inquirers of any particular period. This means that there will always be
facts (or plausible candidate facts) about a thing that we do not *know, *because we cannot even conceive
of them. For to grasp such a fact calls for taking a perspective of
consideration that we simply do not have, since the state of our
knowledge (or purported knowledge) has not yet advanced to a point at
which its entertainment is feasible. In bringing conceptual innovation
about, cognitive progress makes it possible to consider new
possibilities that were heretofore conceptually inaccessible.

After all, could we ever actually achieve erotetic completeness (*Q*-completeness)—the condition of being
able to resolve, in principle, all of our (legitimately posable)
questions about the world? Could we ever find ourselves in this
position?<sup>2</sup> In theory, yes. A body of science certainly could
be such as to provide answers to all those questions it allows to arise.
But just how meaningful would this mode of completeness be?

It is sobering to realize that the erotetic completeness of a state of
science, *S,* does not necessarily
betoken its comprehensiveness or sufficiency. It might reflect the
paucity of the range of questions we are prepared to contemplate—a
deficiency of imagination, so to speak. When the range of our knowledge
is sufficiently restricted, then its *Q*-completeness will merely reflect
this impoverishment rather than its intrinsic adequacy. Conceivably, if
improbably, science might reach a purely fortuitous equilibrium between
problems and solutions. It could eventually be “completed” in the narrow
ero-tetic sense—providing an answer to every question one can raise in
the then-existing (albeit still imperfect) state of knowledge—with-out
thereby being completed in the larger sense of answering the questions
that would arise if only one could probe nature just a bit more deeply.
And so, our corpus of scientific knowledge could be erotetically
complete and yet fundamentally inadequate. Thus, even if realized, this
erotetic mode of completeness would not be particularly meaningful. (To
be sure, this discussion proceeds at the level of supposition contrary
to fact. The exfoliation of new questions from old in the course of
scientific inquiry that is at issue in Kant’s principle of
question-propagation spells the infeasibility of ever attaining *Q*-completeness.)

The preceding considerations illustrate a more general circumstance. Any
claim to the realization of a *theoretically* complete science of
physics would be one that affords “a complete, consistent, and unified
theory of physical interaction that would describe all possible
observations.”<sup>3</sup> But to check that the state of physics on
hand actually meets this condition, we would need to know exactly what
physical interactions are indeed possible. And to warrant us in using
the state of physics on hand as a basis for answering this question, we
would already have to be assured that its view of the possibilities is
correct—and thus already have preestablished its completeness. The idea
of a consolidated erotetic completeness shipwrecks on the infeasibility
of finding a meaningful way to monitor its attainment.

We can reliably estimate the amount of gold or oil yet to be discovered,
because we know a priori the Earth’s extent and can thus establish a
proportion between what we know and what we do not. But we cannot
comparably estimate the amount of knowledge yet to be discovered,
because we do not have and cannot have a way of relating what we know to
what we do not. The very idea of cognitive limits thus has a paradoxical
air. It suggests that we claim knowledge about something outside
knowledge. But (to hark back to Hegel) with respect to the realm of
knowledge, we are not in a position to draw a line between what lies
inside and what lies outside—seeing that, ex hypothesi we have no
cognitive access to the latter. One cannot make a survey of the relative
extent of knowledge or ignorance about nature except by basing it on
some picture of nature that is already in hand—that is, unless one is
prepared to take at face value the deliverances of existing science.
This process of judging the adequacy of our science on its own telling
is the best we can do, but it remains an essentially circular and
consequently inconclusive way of proceeding. The long and short of it is
that there is no cognitively adequate basis for maintaining the
completeness of science in a rationally satisfactory way.

To monitor the theoretical completeness of science, we accordingly need
some theory-external control on the adequacy of our theorizing, some
theory-external reality-principle to serve as a standard of adequacy. We
are thus driven to abandon the road of pure theory and proceed along
that of the applicative goals of the enterprise. This gives special
importance and urgency to the practical sector.

## Pragmatic Completeness

The arbitrament of praxis—not theoretical merit but practical
capa-bility—affords the best standard of adequacy for our scientific
proceedings that is available. But could we ever be in a position to
claim that science has been completed on the basis of the success of its
practical applications? On this basis, the perfection of science would
have to manifest itself in the perfecting of control—in achieving a
perfected technology. But just how are we to proceed here? Could our
natural science achieve manifest perfection on the side of control over
nature? Could it ever underwrite a recognizably perfected technology?

The issue of “control over nature” involves much more complexity than
may appear on first view. For just how is this conception to be
understood? Clearly, in terms of bending the course of events to our
will, of attaining our ends within nature. But this involvement of “our
ends” brings to light the prominence of our own contribution. For
example, if we are inordinately modest in our demands (or very
unimaginative), we may even achieve “complete control over nature” in
the sense of being in a position to do *whatever we want* to do, but yet attain
this happy condition in a way that betokens very little real capability.

One might, to be sure, involve the idea of omnipotence and construe a
“perfected” technology as one that would enable us to do literally *anything*. But this approach would at
once run into the old difficulties already familiar to the medieval
scholastics. They were faced with the challenge: “If God is omnipotent,
can he annihilate himself (contra his nature as a *necessary* being), or can he do evil
deeds (contra his nature as a *perfect* being), or can he make
triangles have four angles (contrary to *their* definitive nature)?” Sensibly
enough, the scholastics inclined to solve these difficulties by
maintaining that an omnipotent God need not be in a position to do
literally anything but rather simply anything that it *is possible* for him to do. Similarly,
we cannot explicate the idea of technological omnipotence in terms of a
capacity to produce any arbitrary result, wholly without qualification.
We cannot ask for the production of a *perpetuum mobile*, for spaceships with
“hyperdrive” enabling them to attain transluminar velocities, for
devices that predict essentially stochastic processes such as the
disintegrations of transuranic atoms, or for piston devices that enable
us to set *independently* the
values for the pressure, temperature, and volume of a body of gas. We
cannot, in sum, ask of a “perfected” technology that it should enable us
to do anything that we might take into our heads to do, no matter how
“unrealistic” this might be.

All that we can reasonably ask is that perfected technology should
enable us to do anything *that it is
possible for us to do—* and not just what we might *think* we can do, but what we really
and truly can do. A perfected technology would be one that enabled us to
do anything that *can possibly* be
done by creatures circumstanced as we are. But how can we deal with the
pivotal conception of “can” that is at issue here? Clearly, only
science—real, true, correct, *perfected* science— could tell us what
indeed is realistically possible and what circumstances are indeed
inescapable. Whenever our “knowledge” falls short of this, we may well
“ask the impossible” by way of accomplishment (for example, spaceships
in “hyperdrive”), and thus complain of incapacity to achieve control in
ways that put unfair burdens on this conception.

Power is a matter of the “effecting of things possible”—of achieving
control—and it is clearly cognitive state-of-the-art in science that, in
teaching us about the limits of the possible, is itself the agent that
must shape our conception of this issue. *Ever y* law of nature serves to set the
boundary between what is genuinely possible and what is not, between
what can be done and what cannot, between which questions we can
properly ask and which we cannot. We cannot satisfactorily monitor the
adequacy and completeness of our science by its ability to effect “all
things possible,” because science alone can inform us about what is
possible. As science grows and develops, it poses new issues of power
and control, reformulating and reshaping those demands whose realization
represent that key desideratum of “control over nature.” For science
itself brings new possibilities to light. (At a suitable stage, the idea
of “splitting the atom” will no longer seem a contradiction in terms.)
To see if a given state of technology meets the condition of perfection,
we must *already* have a body of
perfected science in hand to tell us what is indeed possible. To
validate the claim that our technology is perfected, we need to *preestablish* the completeness of our
science. The idea works in such a way that claims to perfected control
can rest only on perfected science.

In attempting to travel the practicalist route to cognitive
completeness, we are again trapped in a circle, for short of having
supposedly perfected science in hand, we could not say what a perfected
technology would be like, and thus we could not possibly monitor the
perfection of science in terms of the technology that it underwrites.

Moreover, even if (per impossible) a “pragmatic equilibrium” between
what we can and what we wish to do in science were to be realized, we
could not be warrantedly confident that this condition will remain
unchanged. The possibility that just around the corner things will
become unstuck can never be eliminated. Even if we “achieve control” to
all intents and purposes, we cannot be sure of not losing our grip upon
it—not because of a loss of power but because of cognitive changes that
produce a broadening of the imagination and a widened apprehension as to
what “having control” involves.

Accordingly, the project of achieving practical mastery can never be
perfected in a satisfactory way. The point is that control hinges on
what we want, and what we want is conditioned by what we think possible,
and *this* is something that
hinges crucially on theory—on our beliefs about how things work in this
world. And so control is something deeply theory infected. We can never
safely move from apparent to real adequacy in this regard. We cannot
adequately assure that seeming perfection is more than just that. We
thus have no alternative but to *presume* that our knowledge (that is,
our purported knowledge) is inadequate at this and indeed at any other
particular stage of the game of cognitive completeness.

One important point about control must, however, be noted with care. Our
preceding negative strictures all relate to attainment of perfect
control—of being in a position to do everything possible. No such
problems affect the issue of amelioration—of doing some things better
and *improving* our control over
what it was. It makes perfectly good sense to use its technological
applications as standards of scientific advancement. (Indeed, we have no
real alternative to using pragmatic standards at this level, because
reliance on theory alone is, in the end, going to be circular.) While
control does not help us with perfection, it is crucial for monitoring
*progress*. Standards of
assessment and evaluation are such that we can implement the idea of
improvements (progress), but not that of completion (realized
perfection). We can determine when we have managed to *enlarge* our technological mastery, but
we cannot meaningfully say what it would be to *perfect* it.

## Predictive Completeness

The difficulties encountered in using physical control as a standard of
“perfection” in science all also hold with respect to *prediction*, which, after all, is
simply a mode of *cognitive*
control.

Suppose someone asks: “Are you really still going to persist in plaints
regarding the incompleteness of scientific knowledge when science can
predict *everything*?” The reply
is simply that science will *never* be able to predict literally
everything: the very idea of predicting *everything* is simply unworkable. For
then, whenever we predict something, we would have to predict also the
effects of making those predictions, and then the ramification of *those* predictions, and so on ad
infinitum. The very most that can be asked is that science put us into a
position to predict, not *everything*, but rather *anything* that we might choose to be
interested in and to inquire about. And here it must be recognized that
our imaginative perception of the possibilities might be much too
narrow. We can only make predictions about matters that lie, at least
broadly speaking, within our cognitive horizons. Newton could not have
predicted findings in quantum theory any more than he could have
predicted the outcome of American presidential elections. One can only
make predictions about what one is cognizant of, takes note of, or deems
worthy of consideration. In this regard, one can be myopic either by not
noting or by losing sight of significant sectors of natural phenomena.

To be sure, science itself sets the limits to predictability—insisting
that some phenomena (the stochastic processes encountered in quantum
physics, for example) are inherently unpredictable. And this is always
to some degree problematic. The most that science can reasonably be
asked to do is to predict what it sees as in principle pre-dictable—to
answer every predictive question that it countenances as proper. And
here we must once more recognize that any given state of science might
have gotten matters quite wrong.

With regard to predictions, we are thus in the same position that occurs
with regard to actually interventionist (rather than “merely cognitive”)
control. Here, too, we can unproblematically apply the idea of
improvement—of progress. But it makes no sense to contemplate the *achievement* of perfection. For its
realization is something we could never establish by any practicable
means.

## Temporal Finality

Scientists from time to time indulge in eschatological musings and tell
us that the scientific venture is approaching its end.<sup>4</sup> And
it is, of course, entirely conceivable that natural science will come to
a stop, and will do so not in consequence of a cessation of intelligent
life but in C. S. Peirce’s more interesting sense of completion of the
project: eventually reaching a condition after which even indefinitely
ongoing inquiry will not—and indeed in the very nature of things
can-not—produce any significant change, because inquiry has come to “the
end of the road.” The situation would be analogous to that envisaged in
the apocryphal story in vogue during the middle 1800s regarding the
commissioner of the United States Patents who resigned his post because
there was nothing left to invent.<sup>5</sup>

Such a position is in theory possible. But here, too, we can never
determine that it is actual.

There is no practicable way in which the claim that science has achieved
temporal finality can be validated. The question, “Is the current state
of science, *S*, final?” is one
for which we can never legitimate an affirmative answer. For the
prospect of future changes of *S*
can never be precluded. One cannot plausibly move beyond, “We have (in
*S*) no good reason to think that
*S* will ever change” to obtain,
“We have (in *S*) good reason to
think that *S* will never change.”
To take this posture towards *S*
is to *presuppose its
completeness*.<sup>6</sup> It is not simply to take the natural
and relatively unproblematic stance that that for which *S* vouches is to be taken as true, but
to go beyond this to insist that whatever is true finds a
rationalization within *S*. This
argument accordingly embeds *fi
nality* in *completeness*,
and in doing so jumps from the frying pan into the fire. For it shifts
from what is difficult to what is even more so. To hold that if
something is so at all, then *S*
affords a good reason for it is to take so blatantly ambitious (even
megalomaniacal) a view of *S* that
the issue of finality seems almost a harmless appendage.

Moreover, just as the appearance of erotetic and pragmatic equilibrium
can be a product of narrowness and weakness, so can temporal finality.
We may think that science is unchangeable simply because we have been
unable to change it. But that’s just not good enough. Were science ever
to come to a seeming stop, we could never be sure that it had done so
not because it is at “the end of the road” but because we are at the end
of our tether. We can never ascertain that science has attained the
ω-condition of final completion, since from our point of view the
possibility of further change lying “just around the corner” can never
be ruled out finally and decisively. No matter how final a position we
*appear* to have reached, the
prospects of its coming unstuck cannot be precluded. As we have seen,
future science is inscrutable. We can never claim with assurance that
the position we espouse is immune to change under the impact of further
data—that the oscillations are dying out and we are approaching a final
limit. In its very nature, science “in the limit” relates to what
happens in the long run, and this is something about which we *in principle* cannot gather
information: any information we can actually gather inevitably pertains
to the short run and not the long run. We can never achieve adequate
assurance that *apparent*
definitiveness is *real*. We can
never consolidate the claim that science has settled into a frozen,
changeless pattern. The situation in natural science is such that our
knowledge of nature must ever be presumed to be incomplete.

The idea of achieving a state of recognizably completed science is
totally unrealistic. Even as widely variant modes of behavior by three
dimensional objects could produce exactly the same two-dimensional
shadow-projections, so too could very different law-systems, in
principle, engender exactly the same phenomena. We cannot make any
definitive inferences from phenomena to the nature of the real. The
prospect of perfected science is bound to elude us. The upshot is that
science must always be presumed to be incomplete.

One of the clearest lessons of the history of science is that where
scientific knowledge is concerned, further discovery does not just *supplement* but generally *emends* our prior information.
Accordingly, we have little alternative but to take the humbling view
that the incompleteness of our purported knowledge about the world
entails its potential incorrectness as well. It is now a matter not
simply of *gaps* in the structure
of our knowledge or errors of omission. There is no realistic
alternative but to suppose that we face a situation of real *fl aws* as well, of errors of
commission. This aspect of the matter endows incompleteness with an
import graver than might appear on first view.<sup>7</sup>

## The Dispensability of Perfection

The cognitive situation of natural science invites description in
theological terms. The ambiguity of the human condition is only too
manifest here. We cannot expect ever to reach a position of definitive
finality in this imperfect dispensation: we do have “knowledge” of
sorts, but it is manifestly imperfect. Expelled from the Garden of Eden,
we are deprived of access to “the God’s-eye point of view.” Definitive
and comprehensive adequacy is denied us: we have no basis for claiming
to know “the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth” in
scientific matters. We yearn for absolutes, but have to settle for
plausibilities; we desire what is definitively correct, but have to
settle for conjectures and estimates.

In this imperfect epistemic dispensation, we have to reckon with the
realities of the human condition. Age disagrees with age; different
states of the art involve naturally discordant conceptions and
incommensurate positions. The moral of the story of the Tower of Babel
applies.

The absolutes for which we yearn represent an ideal that lies beyond the
range of practicable realization. We simply have to do the best we can
with the means at our disposal. To aspire to absolutes— for definitive
comprehensiveness—is simply unrealistic.

It is sometimes maintained that such a fallibilist and imperfec-tionist
view of science is unacceptable. To think of science as *inevitably* incomplete and to think of
“the definitive answers” in scientific matters as *perpetually* unattainable is, we are
told, to write science off as a meaningful project.

But in science as in the moral life, we can operate perfectly well in
the realization that perfection is unattainable. No doubt here and there
some scientists nurse the secret hope of attaining some fixed and final
definitive result that will stand, untouchable and changeless, through
all subsequent ages. But unrealistic aspirations are surely by no means
essential to the scientific enterprise as such. In science, as in other
domains of human endeavor, it is a matter of doing the best we can with
the tools at hand.

For the fact that *perfection* is
unattainable does nothing to countervail the no less real fact that
*improvement* is realizable—that
progress is possible. The undeniable prospect of realizable progress—of
overcoming genuine defect and deficiencies that we find in the work of
our predecessors—affords ample impetus to scientific innovation.
Scientific progress is not generated *a
fronte* by the pull of an unattainable ideal; it is stimulated
*a tergo* by the push of
dissatisfaction with the deficiencies of achieved positions. The labors
of science are not pulled forward by the mirage of (unattainable)
perfection. We are pushed onward by the (perfectly realizable) wish to
do better than our predecessors in the enterprise.

We can understand “progress” in two senses. On the one hand, there is
*O*-progress, defined in terms of
increasing distance from the starting point (the “origin”). On the other
hand, there is *D*-progress,
defined in terms of decreasing distance from the goal (the
“destination.”) Consider the picture:

<div>

origin                                          destination

![](main-3.jpg)

the attained position

</div>

Ordinarily, the two modes of progress are entirely equivalent: we
increase the distance traveled from *O* by exactly the same amount as we
decrease the distance remained to *D*. But if there is no attainable
destination—if we are engaged on a journey that, for all we know, is
literally endless and has no determinable destination, or only one that
is “infinitely distant”—then we just cannot manage to decrease our
distance from it.

Given that in natural science we embarked on a journey that is literally
endless, it is only *O*-progress
that can be achieved, and not *D*-progress. We can gauge our progress
only in terms of how far we have come, and not in terms of how far we
have to go. On a journey that is in principle endless, we simply cannot
say that we are nearing the goal.

The upshot is straightforward. The idea of *improving* our science can be
implemented without difficulty, since we can clearly improve our
performance as regards its goals of prediction, control, and the rest.
But the idea of *perfecting* our
science cannot be implemented.

The idea of “perfected science” is that *focus imaginarius* whose pursuit
canalizes and structures our theorizing. It represents the ultimate
telos of inquiry, the idealized destination of a journey in which we are
still and indeed are ever engaged, a grail of sorts that we can pursue
but not possess. The ideal of perfection thus serves a fundamentally
regulative role to mark the fact that actuality falls short of our
cognitive aspirations. It marks a contrast that regulates how we make
and must view our claims, playing a rule akin to that of the functionary
who reminded the Roman emperor of his mortality in reminding us that our
pretensions are always vulnerable. Contemplation of this idea reminds us
that the human condition is suspended between the reality of imperfect
achievement and the ideal of an unattainable perfection. In abandoning
this conception—in rejecting the idea of an “ideal science” that alone
can properly be claimed to afford a definitive grasp of reality—we would
abandon an idea that crucially regulates our view regarding the nature
and status of the knowledge to which we lay claim. We would then no
longer be constrained to characterize our view of things as *merely* ostensible and purported. We
would be tempted to regard our picture of nature as real, authentic, and
final in a manner that we, at bottom, realize it does not deserve.

What is being maintained here is not that “completed and perfected
science” is a senseless conception as such, but rather that the idea of
*attaining* it is senseless. It
represents a theoretically realizable state whose actual realization we
can never achieve. What is unrealizable is not perfection as such but
the *epistemic condition* of
recognizing its attainment. (Even if we arrive, we can never tell that
we’re there!)

But does this situation not destroy “the pursuit of perfection” as a
meaningful endeavor? Here it is useful to heed the distinction between a
*goal* and an *ideal*. A goal is something that we
hope and expect to achieve. An ideal is merely a wistful inkling, a
“wouldn’t it be nice if”—something that figures in the mode of
aspiration rather than expectation. A goal motivates us in striving for
its attainment; an ideal stimulates and encourages. And ideal does not
provide us with a destination that we have any expectation of reaching;
it is something for whose actual attainment we do not even hope. It is
in *this* sense that “perfected
science” is an ideal.<sup>8</sup>

Here, as elsewhere, we must reckon appropriately with the standard gap
between aspiration and attainment. In the practical sphere—in
craftsmanship, for example, or the cultivation of our health—we may
*strive* for perfection, but
cannot ever claim to *attain* it.
And the situation in inquiry is exactly parallel with what we encounter
in such other domains—ethics specifically included. The value of an
ideal, even of one that is not realizable, lies not in the benefit of
its attainment (obviously and ex hypothesi!) but in the benefits that
accrue from its pursuit. The view that it is rational to pursue an aim
only if we are in a position to achieve its attainment or approximation
is mistaken; it can be perfectly valid (and entirely rational) if the
indirect benefits of its pursuit and adoption are sufficient—if in
striving after it, we realize relevant advantages to a substantial
degree. An unattainable ideal can be enormously productive. And so, the
legitimation of the idea of “perfected science” lies in its facilitation
of the ongoing evolution of inquiry. In this domain, we arrive at the
perhaps odd-seeming posture of an invocation of practical utility for
the validation of an ideal.
